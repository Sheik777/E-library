        Open Library started out as an online project designed to preserve interesting websites, ebooks, and other
        digital assets. Its founders wanted to "create a web page for every book ever published."
        Today, users can "borrow" and read millions of ebooks for free. All you need to do is to sign up for an
        account and browse the Open Library. You can even add new books to its collection.

    </p>

    <p>
        Registered users can also create custom lists of ebooks, such as "Want to Read" or "Have Read". If you want
        to
        add a new book to its collection, register on the Internet Archive website, upload your book, and then
        create an
        entry on Open Library. With a quick search, you'll find ebooks in every genre, from art and sci-fi to
        medicine. The history collection,
        for example, features over 1.6 million titles. Luckily, you can filter the results by subject, author, and
        other
        criteria.
    </p>

        Featuring over 32 million ebooks, the Internet Archive is the largest digital library ever created. In
        addition to free ebooks, its catalog includes 591 billion web pages and millions of videos, concerts, audio
        files, and software programs.

        Think of the Internet Archive as a digital time machine. Some items in its collection date back to the '90s
        and are not available anywhere else.

        The ebooks are organized by category, but you can also search by collection, author, topic, or year of
        publishing. There's also a huge selection of ebooks for those with disabilities. At the time of writing, the
        website features popular works such as Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Jaws, and Dune.

    <p>
        If you're looking for a particular book, enter its name in the search bar. Or you can click on random ebooks
        and
        preview or "borrow" them for free. Some people prefer audiobooks vs. physical books, but you won't have to
        choose since this platform offers both.
